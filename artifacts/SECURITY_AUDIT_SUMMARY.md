## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update Vite** (Moderate Priority):
   ```bash
   pnpm update vite@latest
   ```
   - Resolves 4 vulnerabilities
   - Only affects development environment

2. **Review xlsx Usage** (Medium Priority):
   - Current version: 0.18.5
   - Recommended: Download 0.20.2+ from https://cdn.sheetjs.com/
   - Alternative: Switch to a maintained fork
   - **Note**: Impact is limited as:
     - Feature is auth-protected
     - Only processes user's own uploaded files
     - No file sharing between users

3. **Update ESLint Dependencies** (Low Priority):
   ```bash
   pnpm update eslint @eslint/plugin-kit
   ```
   - Resolves 3 low-severity issues
   - Only affects development tools

### Production Deployment
✅ **No critical vulnerabilities affecting production build**

- All high/moderate issues are in development dependencies (vite) or limited-impact features (xlsx)
- Production build (`dist/`) is static HTML/CSS/JS with no server-side vulnerabilities
- Nginx serving configuration includes security headers
- RLS policies protect database access

### Long-term Actions
1. Set up automated dependency scanning (Dependabot, Snyk)
2. Schedule monthly security audits
3. Monitor SheetJS for updates or migration path
4. Keep development dependencies updated

---

## Risk Assessment

### Production Risk: **LOW**
- No critical or high vulnerabilities in production bundle
- xlsx vulnerabilities limited to auth-protected feature
- Vite vulnerabilities only affect dev server

### Development Risk: **MODERATE**
- Vite vulnerabilities could affect dev server if exposed to network
- Mitigation: Don't expose dev server externally (default behavior)

### Overall Status: **ACCEPTABLE FOR PRODUCTION**
- Production build is secure
- Recommended updates available for all issues
- No immediate blocking issues
